$PIZZA SPL Token Exchange – Blueprint & Implementation Guide

1. Project Recap & Clarifications
What We’re Building
A secure, web-based Solana SPL token exchange for $PIZZA, used as a payment, loyalty, and governance token within a pizza-focused ecosystem.
Users create accounts, receive custodial wallets, and buy $PIZZA with fiat (via Stripe).
$PIZZA tokens are non-withdrawable to fiat; they can only be spent at partner restaurants, used for gift cards, or for loyalty/governance.
Gift cards are QR-based, unique per restaurant, and can be shared or donated. They expire 72h after redemption if unused.
Restaurants are vetted and onboarded by the team, receive a fixed 10% commission, and can issue gift cards.
All wallet keys are managed securely (KMS/HSM), and the system is designed for compliance and security.
Governance is handled by a DAO/multisig over the SPL token mint authority and smart contract upgrades.
User onboarding includes email verification and optional 2FA. KYC/AML is handled in-house for cost efficiency.
Loyalty points are awarded for spending $PIZZA at partners (e.g., 5 points per 100 tokens spent).
Unclear/To Be Decided
DAO/multisig tool choice (Squads, Realms, Goki, etc.)
KMS/HSM provider (AWS, GCP, Azure, or on-prem)
Loyalty points: on-chain (as a token) or off-chain (backend DB)?
Smart contract upgradability: immutable or upgradable?
Any regions to block for compliance?
Analytics/reporting needs for partners?
Disaster recovery plan details.



2. System Architecture Overview

Main Components:
Frontend: User dashboard, partner dashboard, gift card redemption, onboarding.
Backend: User management, wallet/key management, KYC/AML, Stripe integration, token minting, gift card logic, loyalty engine, governance interface.
Solana Blockchain: SPL token mint, token accounts, smart contracts (gift card, loyalty, governance).
Security: KMS/HSM for key storage, 2FA, email verification, regular audits.
DAO/Multisig: Controls mint authority, upgrades, and treasury.



3. Implementation Steps

A. Token & Smart Contract Setup
Create SPL Token ($PIZZA_SPL)
Use Solana CLI or SDK to create a new mint with 1B supply, 9 decimals.
Set mint authority to a DAO/multisig wallet.
Reference: Solana Create Mint
Deploy Smart Contracts
Gift card logic (expiry, redemption, partner ID encoding).
Loyalty points (if on-chain).
Governance (DAO/multisig, voting, upgrades).
Ensure contracts are audited before mainnet launch.

B. Backend Development
User Account System
Registration with email verification.
Optional 2FA (TOTP apps like Google Authenticator).
Password reset via secure email link.
Custodial Wallet Management
Generate a new Solana keypair for each user (do not allow import).
Store private keys in a secure KMS/HSM.
Allow users to export their private key (with strong warnings).
Stripe Fiat Onramp
Integrate Stripe for fiat payments.
On successful payment, trigger KYC/AML check.
If KYC passes, mint $PIZZA_SPL to user’s token account.
KYC/AML
Implement tiered KYC (basic for small, enhanced for large purchases).
Store KYC data securely, comply with privacy laws.
Gift Card System
Allow partners to create gift cards (QR code with URL: /redeem?pid=XXXX&amount=YY&code=UNIQUE).
On redemption, transfer tokens to user, start 72h expiry timer.
If not used in 72h, reclaim tokens to ecosystem reserve.
Loyalty Engine
Award points for spending (e.g., 5 per 100 tokens).
Decide if points are on-chain (SPL token) or off-chain (DB).
Partner Onboarding
Manual vetting and approval.
Partner dashboard for gift card creation, sales tracking, commission payout.
Governance Interface
DAO/multisig dashboard for proposals, voting, and upgrades.

C. Frontend Development
User Dashboard
Balance, transaction history, buy $PIZZA, redeem gift cards, view loyalty points.
Partner Dashboard
Gift card creation, redemption stats, commission overview.
Gift Card Redemption Page
Scan QR or enter code, redeem instantly.
Admin Dashboard
User/partner management, KYC review, system analytics.

D. Security & Compliance
Key Management
Use KMS/HSM for all private key operations.
Encrypt all sensitive data at rest and in transit.
Regularly rotate keys and audit access.
Auditing
Third-party smart contract audit.
Regular backend code and access log reviews.
Compliance
Block restricted regions as needed.
Maintain KYC/AML logs for regulatory review.
Disaster Recovery
Regular encrypted backups of DB and key material.
Documented recovery procedures.



4. Sample User Flow
User registers → verifies email → (optionally) sets up 2FA.
User buys $PIZZA with fiat (Stripe) → completes KYC.
Backend mints $PIZZA_SPL to user’s custodial wallet.
User spends $PIZZA at partners, earns loyalty points.
User or partner creates gift card (QR code), shares it.
Gift card is redeemed, tokens transferred, 72h expiry timer starts.
If unused, tokens are reclaimed to ecosystem.
DAO/multisig governs upgrades, treasury, and mint authority.



5. Security; Best Practices
Never store raw private keys in your DB; always use KMS/HSM.
Use HTTPS everywhere.
Enforce strong password and 2FA policies.
Audit all smart contracts before launch.
Regularly review backend and key access logs.
Educate users about risks of exporting private keys.
