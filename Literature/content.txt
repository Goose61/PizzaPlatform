System Layout: Pizza Platform
1. User & Wallet Layer
User Onboarding:
Users register via the frontend (web/mobile), complete KYC, and set up 2FA.
Each user is provisioned a custodial wallet (managed by the backend) or can connect their own Solana wallet.
Token Acquisition:
Users acquire platform SPL tokens (a copy of $PIZZA) via fiat onramps (e.g., MoonPay) or by swapping on a DEX.
SPL tokens are credited to the user’s wallet.
2. Payment Flow
At Point of Sale:
User scans a QR code at a participating business.
The frontend initiates a payment request to the backend, specifying the amount in SPL tokens.
Atomic Swap:
The backend receives the SPL tokens and, using a DEX aggregator (e.g., Jupiter), immediately swaps them for USDC.
The USDC is sent directly to the business’s wallet (either custodial or self-custody).
This process is atomic: the business never holds SPL tokens, only USDC, eliminating volatility risk.
3. Rewards & Loyalty
Reward Distribution:
For every transaction, the backend calculates and distributes SPL token rewards to the customer’s wallet.
Customers can stake their SPL tokens for additional yield or redeem them for discounts, NFTs, or other perks.
Business Loyalty Vaults:
Businesses can configure custom reward pools (vaults) to incentivize repeat purchases and customer engagement.
4. Admin & Analytics
Admin Dashboard:
Admins manage users, businesses, and monitor transactions via a secure dashboard.
Analytics modules provide insights into sales, customer behavior, and reward effectiveness.
5. Security & Compliance
Authentication:
All endpoints are protected with JWT, session management, and 2FA.
KYC/AML:
Tiered KYC is enforced for both users and businesses, with integration to third-party providers.
Audit Logging:
All critical actions are logged for compliance and monitoring.
6. Fiat Off-Ramp
USDC Withdrawal:
Businesses can transfer USDC to a centralized exchange (CEX) that supports Solana USDC.
From the CEX, they can sell USDC for fiat and withdraw to their bank account [Solflare Help Center].

Key Engineering Principles
Atomicity: Payments are atomic swaps—SPL tokens are converted to USDC in a single backend operation, so businesses never face token volatility.
DEX Aggregation: All swaps use DEX aggregators for best price and minimal slippage, leveraging deep liquidity pools [0x Aggregator Analysis].
Security: End-to-end encryption, robust authentication, and audit logging are enforced.
Compliance: KYC/AML is integrated at both user and business levels.
Extensibility: Loyalty and rewards logic is modular, allowing businesses to customize incentives.
Separation of Concerns:
Frontend: Handles user interaction, QR scanning, and displays rewards.
Backend: Orchestrates payments, swaps, rewards, compliance, and analytics.
Blockchain Layer: Handles token transfers, swaps, and staking logic.
