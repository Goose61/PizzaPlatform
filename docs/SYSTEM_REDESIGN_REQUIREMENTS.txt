1. Business Model Restructuring
Current System Issues:
Complex multi-layered staking with NCN/CN distinctions.
Fiat off-ramps for NCN merchants trigger MSB licensing.
Over-engineered vault system and custodial wallets.
Generic KYC without cost-effective integration.
Lack of Web3 engagement features (e.g., gaming, AI).

Required Changes:
Crypto-Native Only: Support 10 CN merchants (e.g., crypto cafes, NFT shops) accepting USDC, eliminating NCN merchants and fiat off-ramps.
Unified Fee Structure: 1% platform fee ($0.15) + 1.3% vault contribution ($0.195) per $15 transaction for all merchants.
Platform Vault System: Single vault ($7,117.50/merchant/year, $71,175 total) funds rewards ($47,974.40) and gift card redemptions ($6,000), with optional Kamino staking (4% APY, $1,190.70 split: $595.35 platform/merchants). Surplus: $23,200.60.
Web3 Engagement: Add Pizza Defenders (Telegram dApp, $10,000 revenue) and Agent Crust AI (X/Telegram, 10% volume increase: $6,022.50 fees).



2. Payment Processing Overhaul
Current System:Mixed fiat/crypto payments with NCN fiat conversions.
Complex fee structures (1.45% NCN, 1% CN).
Unclear QR code generation and settlement.

Required Implementation:
Standardize Transaction Amount: Fixed $15 USDC or $PIZZA SPL via Solana Pay ($0.00025/transfer).
QR Code Generation: Platform backend generates dynamic/static QR codes via Solana Pay, displayed on merchant dashboard (web/POS) or e-commerce API ($1,000 setup, included in $7,500 Solana).
Atomic Swaps: Jupiter DEX integration for $PIZZA SPL to USDC (0.75% customer-absorbed loss).
Automated Settlement: $14.655 USDC to merchant’s non-custodial wallet (Phantom/Solflare) after 1% fee ($0.15) and 1.3% vault ($0.195).
Fee Distribution: Platform fees to treasury, vault contributions fund rewards/gift cards.



3. KYC/Compliance Integration
Current System:Generic KYC with multiple providers.
MSB licensing required due to fiat handling.
Unclear AML/CTF framework.

Required Changes:
Ramp/MoonPay Integration: KYC via Ramp ($0.50/customer, $273.75/merchant for 547.5 customers), MoonPay as backup, for $PIZZA investment token conversions (10%, 3,285/year).
Fiat On-Ramps: Ramp/MoonPay (0.1% ACH, 2–3% cards) for USDC/$PIZZA SPL purchases, covered by their MSB licenses.
Compliance Framework:AML/CTF via Ramp/MoonPay’s 5-year record retention and SARs.
No MSB for 180 days (crypto-only, non-custodial). Legal consultation ($2,000) confirms deferral to month 12 ($5,500–$15,500, funded by $8,410.05 profit or $23,200.60 surplus).
GENIUS Act compliance (no issuer-paid yields; Kamino staking DeFi-based).

Interim AML: $3,000 policy, $500/year manual monitoring (<$2,000 transactions, no SARs).



4. Rewards System Simplification
Current System:Complex tiered rewards and NCN/CN vaults.
Unclear token economics and gift card funding.
No Web3 engagement features.

Required Implementation:Fixed Reward Rate: 0.3 $PIZZA SPL ($0.15 cost: $0.10 monetary, $0.05 non-monetary) per $15 transaction, minted to customer’s non-custodial wallet (Phantom/Solflare), funded by vault ($7,117.50/merchant).
Gift Card System: 1,200 NFT gift cards/merchant/year (100/month, 5 $PIZZA SPL, $0.50 minting, merchant-funded: $600 cost, $300 net after 50% unused). Redemptions ($600/merchant) vault-funded.
Merchant Loyalty Perks: Customizable (e.g., 3 $PIZZA SPL = 10% discount, 20 = NFT).
Investment Token Conversion: 10 $PIZZA SPL + $0.10 USDC = 1 $PIZZA (1M cap, 10% conversion, 3,285/year, KYC via Ramp/MoonPay).
Treasury Management: Unused gift cards (30 days) and inactive tokens (2 years) revert to treasury (48,285 $PIZZA SPL, 0.48% of 10M cap).
Web3 Engagement: Pizza Defenders ($1 = 10 $PIZZA SPL, $10,000 revenue) and Agent Crust AI (8–12 X posts/day, $3,000 setup, $6,000/year).



5. Wallet Architecture Changes
Current System:Custodial wallets for NCN merchants.
Complex key management for mixed tokens.

Required Implementation:
Non-Custodial Only: Phantom/Solflare wallets for all customers and merchants, eliminating custodial liability.
Multi-Token Support: $PIZZA SPL, gift card NFTs, USDC in single wallet.
Investment Token Handling: Secure storage for $PIZZA investment tokens with governance (1 token = 1 vote).
Token Allocation: 0.3 $PIZZA SPL minted directly to customer’s wallet via smart contract, allowing hold, spend, convert, or sell on DEXs (Jupiter/Raydium, 0.75% loss).
